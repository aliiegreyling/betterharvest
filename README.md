# betterharvest

Agentic product-development workspace combining **BMAD Method** (workflow spine), **Serena MCP** (semantic code intelligence), and **Forge** (the in-repo agentic CLI we're building) into a single coherent harness for taking ideas from prompt → planned → scaffolded → maintained software.

This repository is both a working environment and the home of an evolving product: the **Agentic Workflow CLI Harness**, currently implemented as `forge/`.

## What's in this repo

| Layer | Purpose | Entry Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BMAD Method v6.7.1** | Structured product-development framework (brief → PRD → architecture → stories → delivery) | `_bmad/`, skills like `bmad-help`, `bmad-prd` |
| **Serena MCP** | Semantic code intelligence (symbols, references, memories, diagnostics) | `.serena/project.yml`, `.serena/serena.sh` |
| **Forge CLI** | Chat-first agentic SDLC team that shells out to `claude` and `codex` with per-role model routing and human sign-off gates | [forge/](forge/README.md) |
| **Agent guidance** | Keeps every agent (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot) aligned on conventions | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), [CODEX.md](CODEX.md) |
| **Planning artifacts** | All product/architecture/design output from BMAD + Forge | [_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/) |
| **Durable docs** | Long-lived project knowledge that survives sessions | [docs/](docs/README.md) |

## Quick Start

### 1. Orient yourself

Read in this order:

1. This README (high-level)
2. [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) — what we're building and why
3. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — how the pieces fit
4. [forge/README.md](forge/README.md) — the working CLI
5. [_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/agent-cli-harness-brief-2026-05-21/brief.md](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/agent-cli-harness-brief-2026-05-21/brief.md) — the product brief

### 2. Build and try Forge

```bash
cd forge
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js doctor       # verify claude/codex CLIs available
node dist/cli.js status       # detect Git/BMAD/Serena/MCP context
node dist/cli.js models       # list model registry
node dist/cli.js plan "build a CLI todo in Python"
```

Full reference: [docs/forge/cli-reference.md](docs/forge/cli-reference.md).

### 3. Pick a workflow

- Starting a new product idea → [docs/workflows/greenfield.md](docs/workflows/greenfield.md)
- Modifying this repo or another existing one → [docs/workflows/brownfield.md](docs/workflows/brownfield.md)
- Lost? Invoke the `bmad-help` skill from an agent session.

## The Three Layers

### BMAD Method — the workflow spine

BMAD gives us a deterministic SDLC sequence: brainstorm → brief/PRFAQ → PRD → UX → architecture → epics & stories → implementation readiness → sprint plan → story delivery → review. Each step has a dedicated skill (e.g. `bmad-prd`, `bmad-create-architecture`). Artifacts land in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/`.

See: [docs/bmad/README.md](docs/bmad/README.md)

### Serena MCP — semantic code intelligence

Serena replaces "dump the whole file" with symbol-aware lookup, reference graphs, and durable project memories. Configured in `.serena/project.yml` (TypeScript + C# enabled).

See: [docs/serena/README.md](docs/serena/README.md)

### Forge — the agentic CLI we're building

Forge is the executable harness. It does **not** require an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — it shells out to the `claude` and `codex` CLIs you already authenticated locally and routes per SDLC role across Haiku / Sonnet / Opus / Codex.

`forge new` and chat `/new` now run a traditional SDLC team flow: BA requirements → technical architecture → UI/UX design → architecture synthesis → stories → development → QA/testing → local infrastructure → review. Human approval gates are required after BA, architecture synthesis, QA, and infra unless explicitly disabled for local experiments. `forge work` and chat `/work` run the same gated flow against an existing target project, defaulting to `./forge-out`, for iterative change requests.

See: [docs/forge/README.md](docs/forge/README.md)

## Documentation Map

The full documentation index lives at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). Every doc page is markdown and lives in this repo — no external wiki.

- **[docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md)** — product vision, problem, solution
- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** — how BMAD + Serena + Forge fit together
- **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)** — what's shipped, what's next
- **[docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md)** — version-by-version history of Forge
- **[docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md)** — conventions for adding code, docs, planning artifacts
- **[docs/forge/](docs/forge/)** — Forge subsystem deep dive
- **[docs/bmad/](docs/bmad/)** — BMAD usage in this repo
- **[docs/serena/](docs/serena/)** — Serena setup and memory conventions
- **[docs/workflows/](docs/workflows/)** — end-to-end recipes

---

## Project Conventions

- **Planning artifacts** go in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/` — never inline in `docs/`.
- **Durable knowledge** (architecture, conventions, reference) goes in `docs/`.
- **Implementation artifacts** (generated runnable code) go in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/` or the relevant subsystem (e.g. `forge/`).
- **Agent guidance files** (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are kept in sync — change one, change all.
- **No secrets, no machine-specific paths** in committed artifacts. Forge has portable-mode formatters for this.
- **Serena memories** are the long-lived AI memory layer. See [docs/serena/README.md](docs/serena/README.md).
